# 🧠 funCode: Scripts, Snippets, and Semi-Sanity™

Welcome to **funCode** – a personal stash of code, tools, scripts, snippets, hacks, and possibly cursed ideas that *I* find useful. Will you? Who knows. But you're here now, so take a peek.

## 🚧 What is This?
This repo is a digital junk drawer.  
Inside you'll find:

- ⚙️ Handy utilities
- 🧪 Random experiments
- 🐍 Python scripts that solve oddly specific problems
- 🕳️ Code I forgot why I wrote but keep around *just in case*
- 🧩 Stuff that doesn’t fit anywhere else

> Warning: May contain unpolished edges, incomplete thoughts, and zero documentation. Fun!

## 📌 Why?
Because not everything needs to be perfect to be useful.  
This is **not** a library, **not** a framework, and **definitely not** production-grade. It's functional. It's code. It's **funCode**.

## 📁 Structure?
Loose. Like cargo pants with too many pockets.
